# Database-Management

## Mission Statement:

For my final project, I built “Little Taipei” **a restaurant ordering system** for an imaginary Taiwanese restaurant. I created **data specifications and a logical diagram** for my database in order to plan and model the database. I focused on Little Taipei’s menu items, orders, and customers. I used **MySQL, SQL, and Excel** to create and populate my database. After setting up the backend, I built a web interface using **HTML/CSS and Bootstrap** and connected it to the backend using **PHP**. I had a lot of fun with this project because **I love food**! As the granddaughter of a woman who ran her own restaurants after immigrating from Taiwan to the US, I understand that successfully running a restaurant requires an organized information system (and A LOT of hard work). Some questions I want to answer with my database if my site went live would be: 1) What are the most popular food items? 2) What does the average order look like (quantity, number of items, etc.) 3) What is the most common food delivery distance?
